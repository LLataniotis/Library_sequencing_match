# Library_sequencing_match
Perl script that was matching the guides (from an input list) to the fastq files as returned by deep sequencing
In the perl script we should add the input file (list of sgRNAs that were used, in the current uploaded file "MYC_AllElements_hU6_Scaffold.tsv" with two columns, 
Column1 MYC-hU6@1 and Column2 ATATCTTGTGGAAAGGACGAAACACCguideSequenceGTTTTAGAGCTAGAAATAGCAAGTTAAAATAAGGC).
In the shell script we use the fastq file returned by sequencing (in the current uploaded file *.gz) and the results are output in LL_MYC_coverage.txt).
